To understand the project's overall goals, architecture, and setup instructions, please refer to the main `README.md` file. 

When issuing Docker Compose commands, always use `docker compose` (with a space, targeting Compose V2) and not `docker-compose` (with a hyphen, for the older V1).


Available services: frontend, backend, wuzapi, posgres, postgres_wuzapi
Start project services: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
View Logs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs | cat` 
Rebuil all: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d`
Status check: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps`
Database query: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec postgres psql -U admin -d chatwithoats -c "SELECT * FROM portal_users;"`

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://admin:iamhipste

**Note:** After making code changes, check the logs to see if the change was made correctly. If encouter errors, fix them, and check again until fixed.

**Note:** Hot-reloading is enabled for services like the `backend` (Python/FastAPI) and frontend. You typically only need to rebuild if you change dependencies (e.g., add a new Python package to `requirements.txt`) or modify the `Dockerfile` itself. For code-only changes, the services should auto-reload.
